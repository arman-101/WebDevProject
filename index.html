          <p>When Derek Sivers started CD Baby, he wasn't planning on 
            <br>
            building a major business. He was a successful independent 
            <br>
            musician who just wanted to sell his CDs online. He started 
            <br>
            in 1998 by helping his friends sell their CDs too. In 2000, 
            <br>
            he hired his first employee. Eight years later, he sold 
            <br>
            CD Baby for $22 million. </p>

          <p>Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores 
            <br>
            are ready to be settled, and the line between hero and 
            <br>
            villain is sharp enough to draw blood.
            <br>
            Logen Ninefingers, infamous barbarian, has finally run out of luck.
